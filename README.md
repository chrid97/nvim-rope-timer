# fuse.nvim

## What is Fuse?
`fuse.nvim` is inspired by rope timers in digital card games,where players are shown a burning rope to signal that their turn is about to end.

The mechanic encouraging players to act before there turn ends.

I built `fuse.nvim` to experiment with applying the same idea to programming — to spend less time searching for the ideal solution and more time implementing the simplest thing that works.
